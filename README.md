# Bookmarks Challenge

## Instructions
1. Connect to psql

We were tasked with creating a bookmarking tool with the following features:

- Show a list of bookmarks
- Add new bookmarks
- Delete bookmarks
- Update bookmarks
- Comment on bookmarks
- Tag bookmarks into categories
- Filter bookmarks by tag
- Users manage their bookmarks

We broke this down into the user stories below:

1. Show a list of bookmarks
```

Show me a list of bookmarks when I click browse.
```
